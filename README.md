# Consumer-Driven-Contract-Testing-Microservices

A project that was developed as a postgraduate assignment for the master's degree in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence in the subject "AI & Microservices".

The application is implemented in C# with Framework .NET Core 8.0 and Microservice architecture consisting of Data, Service and Controller. As a development tool Visual Studio was chosen. Consumer Driven Contract Testing is a strategy to ensure proper communication between consumer services and providers. This method ensures that the service provider will not violate consumer expectations, allowing for better collaboration and independence of development teams. The PactNet tool is used to record and verify contracts. The goal is to create a fully functional microservice to verify data sent and received between services. </br> </br>

<b>Ιnstallation Ιnstructions:</b> </br> </br>

1. Download the projects (use the ConsumerService.zip and ProviderService.zip).
2. Open the projects with Visual Studio.
3. Run them and explore all its functions.  </br> </br>

<b> Specifically the application will support the following functions: </b> </br> </br>

1. The consumer service can make requests to the provider service and receive the expected responses.
2. The provider service is compatible with the expectations of the consumer, which are defined through a contract.
3. The system is automatically verified to ensure that the services do not violate the contracts.  </br> </br>
